# AVL-to-Max-Heap
School Project. Built and compared my own versions of Max Heap and AVL structures

Program runs through console and generates sets of data in ascending, descending and random orders as well as various sizes.
The data sets are then organized into a Max Heap and AVL structure and their main funcitons are compared for run time.
